# DiceGame
## Rules
This is a simple Dice Game. Player 1 starts and rolls the dice where each roll is added to the score. Player 1 can then "hold" and it will be Player 2's turn or Player 1 can continue rolling. However, if the dice lands on
1, it will be Player 2's turn. The first player to have a score of 100, wins the game!
